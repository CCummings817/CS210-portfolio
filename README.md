# CS-210 Programming Languages Portfolio

Welcome to my CS-210 Portfolio repository. This project represents the culmination of my work in SNHU’s Programming Languages courses, where I applied object-oriented design, file handling, and data analysis principles using various programming languages.

## About Me

I'm a Computer Science major with a concentration in Data Analytics. I’m also currently pursuing certifications in IBM and Microsoft data analysis while building equity-focused data tools as part of the AccessMatters initiative.

## Portfolio Project

Currently the final submission in this repository demonstrates:

- File input/output and text parsing
- Class design using encapsulation and abstraction
- Interactive menu-driven interfaces
- Practical use of STL containers (`unordered_map`)
- Clean, maintainable code with in-line documentation

Feel free to explore the code and reach out with any feedback or questions. Below are a few more details about this project

## Project: Corner Grocer Item Frequency Tracker

### Summary
This project processes purchase records from a grocery store and tracks how often each item is bought. It solves the problem of manually analyzing sales logs by providing frequency counts, histograms, and a data file backup.

### What I Did Well
I structured the code using object-oriented principles and a clean, menu-driven interface. I also followed C++ best practices with clear function separation, comments, and formatted output.

### What I Could Improve
Adding more robust input validation and unit tests would enhance reliability. Wrapping more functionality into reusable helper classes could improve scalability.

### Challenges and Solutions
Implementing the histogram formatting and map-based frequency counting was challenging at first. I used C++ references, STL documentation, and examples from zyBooks to resolve those.

### Transferable Skills
Using `unordered_map`, file I/O (`ifstream`/`ofstream`), and class structures will apply directly in future data processing and analytics projects — especially for parsing and reporting.

### Maintainability and Readability
I used inline comments, descriptive variable names, and modular code design to ensure the program is easy to read and modify. This supports future reuse or expansion.
