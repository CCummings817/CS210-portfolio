# CS-210 Programming Languages Portfolio

Welcome to my CS-210 Portfolio repository. This project represents the culmination of my work in SNHU’s Programming Languages course, where I applied object-oriented design, file handling, and data analysis principles using C++.

## About Me

I'm a Computer Science major with a concentration in Data Analytics. I’m currently pursuing certifications in IBM and Microsoft data analysis while building equity-focused data tools as part of the AccessMatters initiative.

## Portfolio Project

The final submission in this repository will demonstrate:

- File input/output and text parsing
- Class design using encapsulation and abstraction
- Interactive menu-driven interfaces
- Practical use of STL containers (`unordered_map`)
- Clean, maintainable code with in-line documentation

Feel free to explore the code and reach out with any feedback or questions.
